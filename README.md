# WinThing

![Build Status](https://github.com/msiedlarek/winthing/workflows/build/badge.svg)

A modular background service that makes Windows remotely controllable through MQTT. For home automation and Internet of Things.

## :warning: Deprecation Notice :warning:

**WinThing is no longer actively maintained.** As an alternative, please consider [IOT Link](https://iotlink.gitlab.io/), which is actively maintained and has a lot more features, including most of WinThing's features.

## Requirements

Java 8 or greater.

## Running

Download either JAR or EXE file from [Releases page](https://github.com/msiedlarek/winthing/releases) and execute it:

	target/winthing-1.4.2.exe
    java -jar target/winthing-1.4.2.jar

## Configuration

Configuration parameters can be passed from command line or they can be placed in configuration files in the working directory from where you launch WinThing.

<table>
<tr><th>Property</th><th>Description</th><th>Default</th>
<tr><td>broker</td><td>URL of the MQTT broker to use</td><td>127.0.0.1:1883</td></tr>
<tr><td>username</td><td>Username used when connecting to MQTT broker</td><td>mqtt</td></tr>
<tr><td>password</td><td>Password used when connecting to MQTT broker</td><td>mqtt</td></tr>
<tr><td>clientid</td><td>Client ID to present to the broker</td><td>WinThing</td></tr>
<tr><td>prefix</td><td>Prefix for all MQTT topics used by this WinThing instance</td><td>winthing</td></tr>
<tr><td>reconnect</td><td>Time interval between connection attempts in seconds</td><td>5</td></tr>
</table>

### Command line parameters

Example how to pass parameters from command line:

	java -Dbroker="127.0.0.1:1883" -jar winthing-1.2.0.jar

### winthing.conf

WinThing will look for this file in the current working directory (directory from where you launched WinThing). Create this file and put desired parameters into it.

Example file:

	broker = "127.0.0.1:1883"
	username = "mqtt"
	password = "somesecret"

### winthing.ini

By default WinThing executes any command it receives in the system/commands/run topic. Create this file in the current working directory to whitelist only specific commands. The file contains an unique string identifier (used as payload in the MQTT message, see below) and path to executable.

Example file:

	notepad = "c:/windows/system32/notepad.exe"
	adobe = "c:\\program files\\adobe\\reader.exe"

*Note you can use slash* ' / ' *or double backslash* ' \\\\ ' *as path separator.*

## Logging

You can open application log by clicking on the tray icon. To log into **winthing.log** file in the current working directory run WinThing with the **-debug** parameter.

	winthing.exe -debug

## Supported messages

The payload of all messages is either empty or a valid JSON element (possibly a primitive, like a single integer). This means, specifically, that if an argument is supposed to be a single string, it should be sent in double quotes.

Example valid message payloads:

* `123`
* `true`
* `"notepad.exe"`
* `[1024, 768]`
* `["notepad.exe", "C:\\file.txt", "C:\\"]` (note that JSON string requires escaped backslash)

### Broadcast status
